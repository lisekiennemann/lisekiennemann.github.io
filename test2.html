<p> But in Chamonix, where glaciers are towering above homes, some residents are “worried”.

    "I live in a corridor just below the Dôme du Goûter glacier. Who's monitoring it? No one," says Blaise Agresti, a former commander of the town's high-mountain gendarmerie platoon. 
    
    Agresti points to Switzerland as an example, a country described as “ahead of France in terms of systematic inventory and assessment of glacial risk” in the 2023 state report. 
    
    "The risks are already there and in France, we're still in the process of identifying dangerous areas. We may be ten years behind and in the meantime, an event might sweep through a valley. Either we're lucky and it misses us, or we'll have ten, twenty deaths," Agresti says.
    
    “Reactive mode”
    
    While a few risks have already been prevented, they have often been identified "by chance", according to the report, showing the importance of tackling the problem more systematically.
    
    In 2021 for instance, an IGE researcher found out about a lake forming at the foot of the Bossons Glacier in the Chamonix Valley. This lake, which had appeared three years earlier, was rapidly growing due to the accelerated melting of the glacier. Only an ice dam was preventing it from flowing down the steep slope leading to the peaceful village of Les Bossons. 
    
    Simulations showed that the water and ice wave that could result from an overflow would endanger the hamlet, its school, railway line, and wooden chalets. Scientists alerted the local authorities, which dug a channel in 2023 to preemptively divert the lake’s water towards a neighbouring stream.
    
    Today, the former lake bed is nothing but pebbles. Only a camera installed by the IGE to monitor the glacier's evolution serves as a reminder of the averted danger. 
    
    
    This summer, another glacial lake near the Tignes resort will undergo the same draining procedure. "But currently, we often find ourselves in a reactive mode," Ravanel says.
    Ongoing research
    The ONF says one of the reasons why assessing systematically the risks takes time is because we still have little understanding of these phenomena. For instance, research has difficulty in predicting the trajectory of pieces of glaciers breaking off, which is crucial to draw up risk maps and constrain urban development.
    "The difficulty is that there are very few glacial events and even fewer documented ones. We are facing a lack of data," Gagliardini says.
    Located next to the Bossons Glacier, the Taconnaz Glacier is closely monitored by scientists. Its 406 million cubic meters of ice are suspended above the village of Les Houches and its 3,000 permanent inhabitants.
